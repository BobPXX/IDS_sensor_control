Python code to control U3-3882SE-C (IDS peak).

Install: https://en.ids-imaging.com/files/downloads/ids-peak/readme/ids-peak-windows-readme-1.2_EN.html

- Functionality: A Lensless camera equipped with IDS sensor is placed in front of a monitor. Images are displayed one by one on the monitor, and the camera is triggered to capture them.
- Dataset collection performed in below papers are using this code.
